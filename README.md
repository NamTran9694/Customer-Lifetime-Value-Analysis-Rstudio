# Customer-Liftime-Value-Analysis
Linear regression to predict Customer Lifetime Value and Logistic regression to predict the renew response
In this project, we have a dataset that includes information of customers of a insurance company.
The data has 24 variables that are the background and behaviours of customers.
Our target is to predict the Customer Lifetime Value base on the variables.
Beside that, we alse have to predict whether a customer would accept or reject a renewal offer when the current contract expire.
